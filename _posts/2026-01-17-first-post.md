Hello, thanks for stopping by! My name is Joe Imhoff, and this is my first post to my portfolio site. I know I'm late to the game; I've been doing full-stack development for the last 15 or more years (depending on how you think about it).

I started out doing freelance work for people's businesses back in the early 2000's. More and more people needed websites, driving me to learn how to build a framework from the ground up and how to serve it to the world. I loved it, and it just snowballed from there.

I've had the pleasure of working with and meeting many talented, smart people driven by solving problems and by technology itself. I've managed and worked on teams that have done challenging and amazing work.

Things are changing in our industry at a mad pace, and I wanted a place to demonstrate my skills and talk about the world of technology as it goes through this transition.

### What's Next?
I don't think it's any secret. AI is what's next. Software engineering has forever been changed by the availability of LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. But let's be clear, it hasn't completely devastated the existing landscape. It's simply made it possible to code for more outcomes more quickly. Not cheaper, and arguably not better, but a broader spectrum of outcomes is now possible. The skills I've learned since the beginning of my career are still relevant today, but are different with the advent of LLMs.

I'll be spending more of my time deploying and maintaining **agentic AI** and **RAG systems**. Finding new ways to take these burgeoning tools and finding new and exciting ways to solve problems and tackle challenging problems.

It's an exciting time. I truly think that those who keep a cool head and don't buy into the hype, but instead figure out the slow walk to success with AI, will benefit the most and waste the least.
