Hello, my name is Joe Imhoff. I've been a full-stack developer since the early 2000's. That's when I started my freelance career doing something that I would love to do and find joy doing, building software.

Out of necessity, I had to learn how to deploy severs and do system administration, and actually learn how to write applications from the ground up, all before finally serving them. I would take everything from that time and grow it through my career over the next 15 years. Where I've worked on devops, mobile, desktop, and web development teams delivering highly available and highly responsive small to enterprise applictions.

### What's Next?
I don't think it's any secret. AI is what's next. Software engineering has forever been changed by the availability of LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. But let's be clear, it hasn't completely devestated the existing landscape. It's simply made it possible to code for more outcomes more quickly. Not cheaper, and arguably not better, but a broader spectrum of outcomes are now possible. The skills I've learned since the beginning of my career are still relevant today, but are different with the advent of LLMs.

I'll be spending more of my time deploying and maintaining **agentic AI** and **RAG systems**. Finding new ways to take these burgeoning tools and will them to the needs of my employers or clients.

It's an exciting time. I truly think that those that keep a cool head and don't buy into the hype, but instead figure out the slow walk to success with AI will benefit the most and waste the least.
