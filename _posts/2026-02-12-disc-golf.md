title: Disc Golf

I thought the perfect way to start off a professional blog about myself would be to talk about disc golf. I have many passions in my life: my dogs, my relationships, video games, art, literature, and work (yes, work is in there).

Let’s begin with my favorite pastime, though, disc golf. If you haven’t heard of disc golf, then it’s like ball golf, where you have a course with 18 holes, and you are trying to get your disc into a basket in fewer throws than an agreed-upon average called par. That’s the quick version. The lower the score, the better.

My favorite part of the sport is that the discs are designed for distance. Where a par 3 ball golf might be 300 yards, or anything under 300 feet in disc golf, automatically. You’re not throwing anything 300 yards with your two to four foot arm; it’s just physically very difficult. So the discs cut sideways through the air. And they’re much harder than regular discs; you probably don’t want to play frisbee with a disc, even though they look very similar.

There’s something majestic about throwing a disc way to the side, knowing that the disc is going to pull and correct to the basket. As an added bonus, this feature of the disc allows for clever course design in disc golf.

## Call to Action

Get out and try disc golf. Maybe it’s not your thing, maybe you’ll fall in love with it as I did. I’ve made a lot of friends, even as an adult, playing disc golf. Get outside and enjoy the planet before it burns up from climate change or is just covered in Ebola.

### It’s super cheap

Ball golf can cost you hundreds in clubs and equipment, cheap equipment. And then it costs you around \$30 to go play. Disc golf, though, is $30 for a starter kit, and you’re done. Almost all courses are completely free.

### It’s fun!

Throw the disc, watch it soar. Watch the magical art of aerodynamics and master your throwing technique. And it’s a great way to spend an hour or two with friends. Overall, you can quit at anytime. Maybe you hate it and want to go home; you can. But if you love it as I do, you can spend every weekend trying to find a little time, even in the freezing cold, to get out and go on a disc hike. Enjoy yourself. Most importantly, enjoy your life.
