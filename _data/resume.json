The design made subclass creation straightforward, which enabled us to transform a project that would have taken 18 months with the previous setup into a fully extensible, easy‑to‑learn service completed in just 3 months.

I routinely recommend D3.js to my direct reports and colleagues for any project requiring detailed diagrams, maps, or intricate data interactions.

I’ve applied this skill in two high‑impact scenarios:<br/><br/><b>SpringLeaf – Ruby on Rails Email Service Framework</b> – I built a superclass that understood the email service architecture, its safety requirements, and idempotent design. Sub‑classes automatically generated comprehensive test suites (commit‑ready with a single command), while the framework enforced Rails conventions, provided detailed documentation, and surfaced warnings or errors. The result was a superset service that turned minimal input into a fully‑featured, test‑ready component.<br/><br/><b>CellTrak – PHP/Symfony IVR DSL</b> – While developing an IVR system in PHP with Symfony, I created a lightweight domain‑specific language that let project managers describe phone interactions—from menu navigation to background callbacks—in natural, declarative syntax. The DSL handled data collection, audio file references, and interaction logic, enabling developers to focus on testing rather than plumbing code. This required harnessing PHP’s ReflectionClass, __call, and Symfony’s Compiler Passes to inject generated code into the service container at compile time.<br/><br/>These projects demonstrate my ability to leverage language‑specific metaprogramming features to deliver clean, reusable, and fully‑tested code generators that adapt to the needs of a given codebase."
