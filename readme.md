# Welcome!

This is the repository for my portfolio site.

If you want to check it out go to https://joeimhoff.com

### Why?

Well, I don't know just yet. You probably want to find out about my [work history](https://joeimhoff.com/resume/), borring!
Or maybe you want to see my [blog posts](https://joeimhoff.com/projects/) about technology, professional topics, or topics I'm passionate about. For instance I just made a tiny post about [disc golf!](https://joeimhoff.com/2026/02/12/disc-golf.html)

### Bare With Me

I'm just getting started at this blogging thing. Hopefully I'll get better, and hopefully I'll talk about at least one thing you're interested in.

### Is this a good representation of my skills?

If you're looking at this repo to see what I'm capable of, I'd look to the content of my posts to come. The code to launch a jekyll server on GitHub Pages is pretty simple compare to some of the complex and enterprise level software applications that I've worked on. 

If you want to know what else is going on here, I used Rollup to write JavaScript modularly, and it's a pretty small collection of ideas. And Jekyll has a Sass compiler built in, which I've leveraged into well organized SCSS files. Otherwise, I'm leveraging the Ruby templating and bundling to get Jekyll working.
